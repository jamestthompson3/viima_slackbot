# Viima Bot

Welcome to Viima bot! This will help you integrate the Viima platform into your team's slack channel.
To get started, clone the repo and run `npm install`, followed by `node app.js`.

The bot scans you Viima board and updates in real-time. It also has a few built-in commands to help with your workday.
